# Java-SortComparison

This program compares the measured completion time for several common sorting algorithms. Algorithms are tested using multiple data sets of varying size and complexity (ascending, descending, random). The results of the comparison are printed to a text file called "sort_results.txt"

Instructions:

1.) Import this project into Eclipse.

2.) Run the program called "SortTester.java"

3.) Open the file called "sort_results.txt" to observe the comparison of different sorting algorithms
